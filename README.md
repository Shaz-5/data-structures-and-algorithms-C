# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains C programs that implement various data structures and algorithms. Each program is designed to demonstrate the implementation and usage of a specific data structure or algorithm.

## Contents

1. Binary Tree (`binarytree.c`)
2. Binary Search Tree (`BST.c`)
3. Binary Search Tree with Linked List (`BST_ll.c`)
4. Circular Queue (`circular_queue.c`)
5. Double-Ended Queue (`deque.c`)
6. Hashing (`hashing.c`)
7. Linked List (`linked_list.c`)
8. Polynomials (`polynomials.c`)
9. Priority Queue (`priority_queue.c`)
10. Queue (`queue.c`)
11. Queue with Linked List (`queue_linked_list.c`)
12. Sparse Matrix (`sparse_matrix.c`)
13. Stack (`stack.c`)
14. Stack with Linked List (`stack_linked_list.c`)
15. Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search (`BFS_DFS.c`)
16. Union-Find (`union_find.c`)

Feel free to explore each directory for detailed implementations.

## How to Use

Each C program is standalone and can be compiled and run independently. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

To compile a program, use the following command:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
```

To run the compiled program, use:

```bash
./filename
```
