Algorithm for BFS and DFS:

Step1: Start.
Step2: Input number of vertices.
Step3: Create array for adjacency matrix.
Step4: Start a loop to enter the connections of each vertex, input 0 for no connection and 1 for connection.
Step6: Print the adjacency matrix.
Step7: Print the BFS and DFS Traversals.
Step8: Stop.


DFS():
Step1: Start.
Step2: Print the root.
Step3: Start a loop to traverse through the graph and add vertices to an array and print each vertex value if not already visited(using recursion).
Step4: Stop.


BFS():
Step1: Start
Step2: Print the root.
Step3: Start a loop to traverse through the graph and add vertices to a queue and print each vertex value if not already visited(using recursion).
Step4: Stop.
